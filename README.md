I believe u/WyzeDS was the original creator? It seems like he took the images in the DOC i received in my work email.

You will need

    MicroSD card, 16MB capacity or more.

    USB A to A cable, the micro USB port does not work with this firmware!

    Firmware (demo.bin) file

What you need to know

    WYZE will not offer support for this mode.

    The speaker will act as a USB output, windows will try to default to the speaker. If you don't want this to happen. Disable the speaker output in windows!

    Microphone does work but the quality isn't the best

    There is lens distortion. And a high viewing angle. It will look kinda funny if you are very close to the camera.

    After everything is done, you do NOT need to keep the microSD card in the WYZE cam anymore.

    Make sure the SDcard is in FAT32

    This will disable all WIFI functions, you can not access it from a WYZE app.

    You can restore WYZE functions by downloading regular firmware and following the same instructions.

Instructions

    Get a USB A to A cable ready, plug one end to the computer, do not plug in the WYZE cam YET.

    Place the BIN file into a fat32 sdcard

    Eject the sdcard from your computer, insert it into the wyze cam

    HOLD the SETUP button

    INSERT the other end of the USB A TO A cable into the WYZE CAM. KEEP HOLDING

    Watch for the status light to turn BLUE, You can let go of the setup button BUT DO NOT REMOVE CABLE

    Eventually, the wyze cam will be detected as a HD CAMERA.

    you can disable speaker output and microphone input if you only need camera functions.
